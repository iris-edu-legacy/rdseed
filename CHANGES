Changes to rdseed 

version 3.44 :
	
	added support for mini seed output
	added "r" option to output response information
	changed "Printers/*.c" to eliminate null pointer crashes
	merged ddl support
	fixed small bugs in parse_nchar.c & parse_double.c

version 3.45

	fixed bug in process_data.c, where under certain circumstances
	a null pointer resulted in program crash. 

	fixed minor bug, if they specified options:ct, then the times data
	output complained. 

	Also added a printout header to the time series output.

	To do....
		update parse routines to skip if zero bytes need mallocing
		add support for multiple alt_response_files
		add date and time to RESP file output.


	modified and fixed some bugs in the free() routines. Put in 
	checks to make sure we weren't deallocating a NULL pointer, etc.

	added code to clear allocated memory to zeros.

	Added code to use multiple alt_response_file

	Added new way of calculating the A0 for AH output.

	If the output is SAC, added response file output.

	Fixed bug wherein program complained if outputing a mini-seed
	and it encountered a blockette 1000 already.

	Fixed a bug wherein the program didn't put the correct
	time out to mini-seed files.

	Fixed a steim compression bug. Program wasn't reading the
	start of data correctly.

		
	Fixed a off-by-one bug in parse_61 - number_of_numerators	

version 3.46

	fixed mini_flag not being reinitialized after every loop thru
	rdseed. Minor bug.

	fixed small problem in process_data where the program returns if
	the logical record's time was outside any selected time. Just let
	it do its thing.

	**** added seed subset generation.  ****

	expanded the decode string too hold complete name (from 5)

	added frequency multiplication to calib factor in output_css.c	

version 4.0

 	Finished seed subset generation. Generates the same seed version
	as the original, if greater than 2.0

	Added more support for network code. Touched a lot of modules. 
	Added new command line for network code. This will allow for 
	duplicate station names.

	Added support for blocks 43..48 in output_ah.

	Changed process_data so it will look for and use the blockette 1000
	information, if there.

	Added individual station/channel/network selection when the user 
	selects the 's' option.
 

	Untangled some minor spagetti which was causing some missed waveforms.

	Changed AH output so it doesn't do inapproriate calculations if 
	channels are AT, SHO, LOG

	Added network code to output file name of RESP files.

	updated the man page	

	Made changes to the way rdseed reads in the header information. 
	Previously, rdseed would read in all stations/channel regardless of
	a specifications made by the user. It would then eliminate station/
	channels at output time. Now it only reads in the requested station/
	channels. Should save memory, especially on dataless seed volumes 
	being linked to miniseed stuff.

version 4.1

        changed all references to patchlevel.h in include statements to a new file
	(called it version.h).  In addition to the PATCHLEVEL, also defines the
	VERSION for use in print statements

		files effected by this procedure:

		Main/output_resp.c
		Main/rdseed.c
		Printers/pagetop.c
		Decoders/process_time_span.c

        changed the output format of the response file information in the following
	files:

		Main/output_resp.c
		Printers/print_53.c
		Printers/print_54.c
		Printers/print_55.c
		Printers/print_56.c
		Printers/print_57.c
		Printers/print_58.c
		Printers/print_60.c
		Printers/print_61.c
		Printers/print_43.c
		Printers/print_44.c
		Printers/print_45.c
		Printers/print_46.c
		Printers/print_47.c
		Printers/print_48.c
		Printers/print_41.c

	this includes changes that add the comment string 
	(through the creation of the
	Include/resp_defs.h include file) and the blockette/field number 
	addresses for parsing.
        Also added the Transfer Function Type to the output in 
	Printers/print_53.c (so that more
	than just the string generated by rdseed is given as the 
	Transfer Function Type)
	and aligned the dictionary reference integers in [53] and [54] so 
	that they
	look better.

        finally, the output for the print_60, find_41 and find_43 through 
	find_48 files were changed
        considerably.  Breaking comments were added to each type of filter, 
	the blockette info from blockette 60 was expanded, and blockette 60
	had a breaking comment 	added.  A new command line option was also
	added to rdseed (-R) to print this new format.  For the time being,
	both RESP file formats will be supported.  Eventually, only this new 
	format will survive.

	the files that were changed to support this "dual" RESP format are:

                Main/output_resp.c
                Main/rdseed.c
                Printers/print_53.c
                Printers/print_54.c
                Printers/print_55.c
                Printers/print_56.c
                Printers/print_57.c
                Printers/print_58.c
                Printers/print_60.c
                Printers/print_61.c
                Printers/print_43.c
                Printers/print_44.c
                Printers/print_45.c
                Printers/print_46.c
                Printers/print_47.c
                Printers/print_48.c
                Printers/print_41.c

	the changes should be easy to remove, since they involved defining a 
	new flag (outresp_old_flag) to output the old format (defined in rdseed.h
	and rdseed.c), adding an option to the command line interpretation section
	of rdseed.c, and duplicating most of the code in the rest of the files
	to add an equivalent function where the dual functions can be identified
	easily by the presence of the string 'old' in the function name that is
	called to support the old format (e.g. old_print_type43 output_old_resp,
	and print_old_resp).  The R option was also added to the interactive part
	of the rdseed program (and made the default if the user asks to extract 
	responses there).

	tjm; 21 July, 1995

	--------------------------------------

	Added support for "weed" 

	Added the 'S' extract station info option

	Added the 'e' extract event info option

	Found a bug in the output_seed stuff, where the program "forgot" to
	output the block 74s.

	Added a routine to output the LOG records, if there. 

	Added summary file processing to rdseed. Added new input line
	to the interactive mode. Input summary file >>>>

	updated man page
	

version 4.11

	added ability to ignore network codes if there. Farm products don't 
	all have network codes.
	fixed bug in free_43.c and free_44.c 

version 4.11a

	If new style resp file output, no Network Code.  Needed a line added.
	fixed RESP file output so it indents properly - an issue for evalresp.
	added the ability to skip channels and network from interactive cmdline.

version 4.12
	An error reading the tapes was fixed. - rdseed.c
	A0 * gains was added to SAC POLES & ZEROS file output for SAC data
	Some internal date format changes for use with WEED - summary.c
	A minor bug with blockette 1000 and steim 2 - output_mini.c
	Minor bug fix to parse_50.c - make sure network code is a null
		string instead of a null byte.
	Added some code to clean up the logical record memory area, 
		problem crops up if logical record size < 4096 
		read_logical_record.c
	Added change so it processes "I" of family 50 - DDL - parse_key.c &
		parse_30.c 

	Also fixed a bug where it separated the timespan if they crossed a
	day boundary.

	rdseed wasn't positioning itself properly when reading 
	multiple tapes volumes.

	AH output was changed, bug fix wherein it didn't get the
	right instrument abbrviation, also added a unit type to the
	comment field, also added hypocenter info in available.

	output_mini.c had a lot of changes needed to fix orientation
	code missing in the geoscope volumes. Also put check in to 
	make sure the number of blockettes is accurate. 

	Fixed a bug in time_span_out.c where the sample count was
	overflowing the sizeof(int)!

	Also, if they specified multiple time slices, it wasn't 
	processing them all.

	output_sac.c - added conversion of CONSTANT value to what we
	do with AH output data, convert from velocity or accel to 
	displacement. 

	Also changed the SAC poles and zeros file to reflect the 
	3 letter channel name in the case of geoscope.

	minor problem with decode_32bit.c, needed unsigned changed to
	a signed int.

    -------------------------------------------------
    fixed a problem with the way that the 'station' information was
    output.  The 'new' RESP file format needed to be consistent with
    the station information so that the blockette and field number
    prefixes could be removed with a simple 'cut' command.  The files
    effected by this change were

        rdseed/Printers/find_30.c
        rdseed/Printers/find_33.c
        rdseed/Printers/pagetop.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_10.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_11.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_12.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_30.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_31.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_32.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_33.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_34.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_35.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_41.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_43.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_44.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_45.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_46.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_47.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_48.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_50.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_51.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_52.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_59.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_70.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_71.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_72.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_73.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_74.c
        rdseed/Printers/print_abrvd.c

    the result of these changes is that all of the 'station' information
    will be preceded by a blockette and field number prefix, as was the
    case with the response information in the RESP files.  This consistency
    should make it easier to parse the station information from this output,
    since the routines that added a prefix to the response output in versions
    4.1, 4.11, and 4.11a were used in the 'station' information output (so
    the station information output had a mixture of blockette/field number
    prefixes for some of the information and no blockette/field number prefixes
    in other parts of the output).  This fix may make this type of output useable
    with evalresp once more.

    Thomas J. McSweeney (tjm@iris.washington.edu), Feb 20, 1996
    -------------------------------------------------

version 4.14

    changed 'print_type50' so that a network code is always printed.  If it
    is a NULL pointer, the string "??" is printed, otherwise the network code
    is printed.

    bug fix to find_41.c to fix problems with output of RESP files containing
    blockette [41] style FIR filters.  Each was followed by a blank line that
    should have contained a '#' character prefix on it.

    -------------------------------------------------

	Added support for differing logical record sizes within
	the data record.

	Added  support for event processing from weed. rdseed
	will place waveforms for each event as found in the
	summary file into seperate directories. This function is
	activated from the weed interface.

	Alpha port:
	Fixed many problems associated with 64bit compilation. At
	the same time fixed many bugs which showed up with Alpha
	port (byte swapped data).

	Added code to place event/station distance, both degrees and
	Km, azimuth and back azimuth into SAC headers. 

	Version support, looks to see the version of weed which is 
	running it.

	added sip and azimuth in AH output.

	Opps, dip and azimuth needed switching in AH header output.

	added dip and azimuth reversal in output_ah.c

	added event lat/lon information in AH headers.

	Changed some longs to ints in steim.c (64bit port)

	Added support for data blockette swapping if needed.

	Small bug fixed in output_css.c where if no description
	entered for instrument type, program would crash.

	Added support for negative BIAS in summary file processing.	

	Took out call to timelocal() and converted to mktime()

	Bug fix in summary file processing where it goofed about 
	what data to grab.

	Changed the output format for event files into a more readable 
	format, as per Ken suggestion. The precision of the floats
	were changed.

	changed decode_geoscope.c so i is insensitive to case when
	scanning for data type code.

	added scan_for_blk_1000() in process_data.c so it would get
	the word order from this if available.	

	Changed process_data.c to do the byte swapping upfront, instead
	of peppered throughout the code.

	The LOG record output wasn't being done right for "Seed" 
	output. WOuld miss the log records.

	Small bug fix for seed output, blockette 74s seek locations
	weren't being computed properly on subsequent interations.

	Took out some longs and other problem spots for Alpha port.

	This version was never releases, went to 4.15 directly from 4.12

                             output_seed.c  =^?- blk 74 needed loc id
                             parse_53.c - no complaints if poles error > 0

	4.16.2 - small fix to bug that seems to have come back in 
		 extract_time_span() where if the data record size 
		 was < logrec size, it didn't properly look at the sub index
		 value as found in the block 74. Off by one
	       - also add in if num_itms < 0 do perror("") in

				and time addition computations from integer to double.

			Include/rdseed.h
				Convert last_sample_rate from float to double.

			Main/steim.c
				Added roundoff to time computations to reduce double->integer
				truncation errors.

				Added function my_anint(), my implementation of anint(),
					which is not in the standard Unix math libraries,
					and avoid having to use sunmath library.

				Fixed problem with year rollover in date.
				Handle leapyears properly.

			Main/output_sac.c
				Added asciiflag argument.
				Reintegrated ascii output output_sac_ascii.c into output_sac.c.
				Ascii output now includes event info, network, location code.

version 4.6:

Work around for CN which has subarray=0.

Changed reference [ix + ] and parens to work in ternary expression in gcc on linux.

Added 40's logic (exercised by CN data)

Change to calculation of timetol, using sample rate, thanks to Chris.

Set sac idep (units).

Set sac evdp *1000.

Made sac poles and zeros files have a unique (based on channel start time) name.

Fixed calculation of epoch time in timetol - caused a leap year boundary problem.

SRS

version 4.7

Change to sample rate sanity check change allowing higher sample rate.

Fixed problem when using an ALT_RESPONSE_FILE with variable record length miniseed.

Fixed some issues which have been showing up on Linux and Macs, among them:
   Included stdlib.h in rdseed.h for proper prototying.
   Fixed summary file memory issues.
   va_arg to more standard usage.
   Explicitly set some key pointers to NULL.
   Changed all reads to freads.

Added -m32 to makefile.

-q option works to specify output dir for RESP files now.

To handle NZ Respons - changed response, add zeros, increment num_zeros, if stage 1.

Optional end time in output filenames - for command line mode, use -O.

Added end time to SAC poles and zeros filename.

Fixed double add of frac sec in timetol and fixed incorrect tolerance check if
clock drift is 0.

Set idep in SAC to unknown upon further consultation of this issue (backed out previous fix).

version 4.7.5
	Added in proper use of SAC 'b' variable
	Re-did the time gap detection btw data records.
	Fixed bugs whe using SEED_ALIAS env
	More memory added upon program startup (seismic buffer)

version 4.8:

	CSS - added the location code support.
	      added in support for little endian data

	event file: some minor incompatiblities crept in between rdseed and JWEED.

	mini seed output: changed to always output with big endian data.
               
	sac file output: added magnitude

	seed file output: bugs fixes relating to multi record length data. Needed some added room for
				the tilde at the end of variable length fields.
			  in correct seed volumes being created under 8086.

	added support for 'M' data

	added support for multiple blockette 11s.

	bug fix: when using multi datalesses rdseed forgot the earlier ones. It only retained the last
		one.
	bug fixe: double free with linux

	bug fix: compile errors using linux

version 5.0

	support for large files. Support for logical record sizes larger than 4k.

	Large files over 2.8 gigs.
	
	Annotated sac poles and zeros

	support for blk 201 byte swapping
	
	allow miniseed output when number of samples == 0. Allows for records with just data blockettes
		to be output
	
	miniseed output goes through the code which prunes the samples to the times requested.

	timecvt.c was changed to allways compute the frac part with decimal places significant. ie
			.1 is one tenth of 10000ths or .0100

	Warning message if ALT_RESPONSE_FILE is being utilized

	Bug fixes. 
		steim.c - needed fixing as the date calculation didn't work when spanning year boundaries
			  ds->xN, ds->x0 need to be swapped back.

		When using a ALT_RESPONSE_FILE rdseed didn't check for variable logical record sizes.

		miniseed output is always 4k

version 5.1

	Support for Windows PC utilizing CYGWIN technology. 

	New output file formats.  Support for 2 SimpleAscii text file formats.

	Changed internal data representation from floats to doubles to allow for
	a greater sample range. New decoder for ieeedouble.


	Rdseed miniseed output as doubles has been added along with the usual steim compressed integers.
	
	More sac poles and zeros annotations:

		Sample Rate
		Instrument type
		Instrument Gain
		Sensitivity
		A0

		have been added to the sac poles and zeros file.

	SAC SCALE usage was changed,  not used as the sensitivity

	SAC EVDP was changed back to KILOMETERS

	Summary file processing was upgraded to better support the M quality data

	Error logging is in one file.  Only logs when an error happened.  	

version 5.2

	Bug fix to poles and zeros file annotations.  There was a date bug in the c date library 
	for when the date was greater than 2038.  

	Edited support files, README, rdseed.l for conformity.

	Some bugs in blockette 40s processing.
	Seed volumes with multi-timespans (b70s) weren't being processed properly.

	Bug in the 'T' option (timeseries) when using x86 and gcc. Missing 1st timeseries
        Minor mods to the option prompts for Comments (added [B]oth).
        Added in some user feedback for RESP file, rdseed station/event files output.

version 5.3

	Quality code preserved for miniseed output

        Upgrades to support JWEEDv4.0's new summary file processing.

        Bug fix for meta-data lacking responses

        Simple ASCII text output's month was off by 1, as it started with jan = 0

        Modification made to allow rdseed's process_data() to only display one error/warning per
                timespan. Previous to this, every data record would result in a message.
      
	Modifications to CSS output files. 
		eliminated duplicate stations in network file.
		added station and channel end times (rdseed.sitechan)
		column EDEPTH changed from meters to Km (sitechan)
		added in channel id to sitechan file
		instead of channel code, made it a combination channel/location code (sitechan) so
		it matches wfdisc

		number of samples limited to maximum as defined in the wfdisc table (99999999)
			issues a warning to the user that it will break at this number
		 
	Fix needed for seed volume output, option '5'.  When large seed volumes are written the
	logical record needed adjustment.

	Fix needed for seed volume output, option '5', when using a dataless seed volume and a mini 
	seed volume. If the resulting seed volume is so large that the logical record needed to be
	greater than what is in the originating dataless, rdseed needed to be programmed to compute and
	use the larger logical record size.

        fixed bug in ieeefloat decoding.

        took out extraneous debug message

version 5.3.1

	Moved AH output back from doubles to floats as most AH processing programs do not support
 	doubles.

	Memory leak when processing with summary files.

	Added in Event Directory processing when a summary file is selected via the command line. Made consistent 
	with the interactive mode. 

	Added the network, station, channel and location to the error message if there was a bad steim 1, 2
		 decompression problem.
